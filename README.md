# HS2-Reversing
How i took apart the HS2 Firmware


Download the firmware for the website this can be done with a linux program such as wget or you can do it with your web browser.

```
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ wget https://www.ailunce.com/Assets/file/Ailunce-HS2-FW-V1.37.zip

ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ 
```
When the firmware has been downloaded the next step is to extract the zip file that its currently compressed into.

```
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ unzip Ailunce-HS2-FW-V1.37.zip 
Archive:  Ailunce-HS2-FW-V1.37.zip
  inflating: AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu  
  inflating: Ailunce HS2 FW-V1.3.7 changelog.txt  
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ ls
'Ailunce HS2 FW-V1.3.7 changelog.txt'   AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu   Ailunce-HS2-FW-V1.37.zip
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ 
```

When the firmware has been extracted it should be noted the firmware file is further compressed 
in a DFU extention. this can be extracted by using the dfuse-pack.py python application attached
to this git repo.


```
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ python3 dfuse_pack.py -d AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu
File: "AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu"
b'DfuSe' v1, image size: 797169, targets: 1
b'Target' 0, alt setting: 0, name: "b'ST...'", size: 796884, elements: 1
  0, address: 0x08000000, size: 796876
    DUMPED IMAGE TO "AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0.bin"
usb: 0483:0000, device: 0x0000, dfu: 0x011a, b'UFD', 16, 0x16c30ebd
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ ls
'Ailunce HS2 FW-V1.3.7 changelog.txt'   AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu   AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0.bin   Ailunce-HS2-FW-V1.37.zip   dfuse_pack.py
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ 

```

As you can see in the above output a bin file is created called `AilunceHS2-FW-1.3.5.dfu.target0.image0.bin` this can then be inspected by a tool built into
linux called `strings` and the usage is as simple as using the tool name and inputing a file name. Lots of strings where found when searching the binary file
so i then decided to source out a few intresting ones.

```
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ strings AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0.bin |grep setup
agent setup
factory setup
user setup
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ 

```
In the above output it was possible to see their may be different levels of access, this was confirmwed by Ailuence had released a blog
post disclosing the route to enter the hidden menu screen within the SET menu on the HS2. Within the blog post it further exposed the "agent setup" 
user access. When confirming the access worked i tried to manully brute force different user accounts by typing in known default pin numbers 
that fit within the lenght of its policy. This is when the "user setup" acount was found by using "000000" as the pin number althought it was
found this user access was nothing useful and with even less rights then the "agent setup" account. 

Blog post: https://www.ailunce.com/blog/setting-item-of-your-Ailunce-HS2

Exact wording from the blog post:

```
It's a hidden setting item. You can do as below if you want to set ITU region.

if you haven't activated your HS2: turn on=>select "NO"=>enter 685911=>long press MENU=>SET=>ham area, via left and right key to select ITU=>long press MENU key to save and exit

if you have activated your HS2: turn on=>long press MENU=>Cursor on the top option above, long press PA, enter 685911=>long press MENU key to save and exit=>reenter SET=>ham area, via left
```


This then made me want to further inspect the binary file and through expecericen i knew Ghidra would be the perfect tool for the job.
https://ghidra-sre.org/

Installing Ghidra can be found here http://www.ylmzcmlttn.com/2019/03/26/ghidra-installation-on-ubuntu-18-04-16-04-14-04/

Once installed start it:

```
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/ghidra_9.2.3_PUBLIC$ ./
docs/       Extensions/ Ghidra/     ghidraRun   GPL/        licenses/   server/     support/    
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/ghidra_9.2.3_PUBLIC$ ./ghidraRun 
```

Proceed by clicking File > New Project, This will then prompt for the type of project. In this write up this was done
as a Non-Shared Project. Select the type and continue by clicking "Next"

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/newproject.JPG)

Create a new project name and directory for the working directory.

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/projectname.JPG)

Next we need to import the binary file that was privously extracted with the python script this can be done
by going to File > Import file as shown in the below screenshot.
![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/importBinary.JPG)
You will see you are next prompted to set the type of language achitecture for the binary file that is being imported.
![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/SelectLang.JPG)

From removing the cover of the radio it was possible to identify the processor and the type

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/chipset.jpg)

Processor user manaul https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/dm00071990.pdf

With the following information it was possible work out the Language for the chipset is Cortex and x86 architecture by selecting the right instruction set
the software will be able to apply its helper plugins to try and show how the application may look deconstructed instead of having to learn Assembler language from 
scratch. The below image shows searching for the cortext language settings when importing the binary to Ghidra

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/cortex.JPG)

Before applying the the type of language we then need to tell Ghidra where to look for the starting point of the data that will be imported
from keeping notes when extracting the firmware you would of noticed the starting address: 0x08000000 this needs to be applied to the settings.

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/cortex-settings.JPG)

after allowing all the changes and the file has imported you will then be prompted with the following windows asking
if you would like to perform analysis on the file for now click "No" as more changes need to be made before procceding.

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/CheckResults-No.JPG)

as privoulsly mentioned we need to perform some more changes the start of the changes will be by
navigating to the Memory manp Tool included withing 

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/findMemMap.JPG)

The proceed to created aa new memory allocation point by clicking the green cross button on the right hand 
side and by looking at the memory allocation map inside the documentation for the memory to extract its self into.

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/flash_clone.JPG)

Finally for memory allocation by again using the resources from the documentation for the processor it was
found by setting the ram we could allocate instructions into virtul memory for later analysis. 

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/ram.JPG)

Now all the memory allocaation sections have been created it is then possible to use the built in analysis tools
by navingating and manully triggering.

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/analysis.JPG)

When the analysis button has been pressed it will be noticed that the application has prompted for settings 
to be selected and for now just select the all button and monitor the bottom right hand status bar. when the status
has then stopped showing instructions it should be completed.

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/options.JPG)

 A really good video on doing exactly this can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4CxE5P6RUE
 
When everything has completed it is then possible to search the binary using
the global search function using the same names that were found when using the strings application.

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/Search.JPG)


![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/gotoCode.JPG)



![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/instructionpointer.JPG)

Its possible to see in the below screen shot the 3 levels of user access we were searching
for in the strings application at the beggining of the process.

* agent setup
* factory setup
* user setup

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/Useraccess.JPG)

Once the varibles have been identified it is possible to path the instruction pointers 
by right clicking and navigating to patch instruction. Then you will be prompted with a
warning that it may not work on the current architecture this is fine to accept and 
continue.

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/findexport.JPG)

Export the file type of Binary and set the export folder to the same folder name that
what used when extracting the original dfu and called `AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0-patched.bin`

![alt text](https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Reversing/blob/main/exportoptions.JPG)


Before repacking the DFU file its worth using the tool md5sum it is also possible to see if your changes have taken place.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ md5sum AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0.bin
dfeaf29113a03b1eb9d8fc08291cd90a  AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0.bin
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ md5sum AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0-patched.bin
62c51b93772cba973aa5adb6b2fdc396  AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0-patched.bin
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ 

```

To repacking the DFU file its as simple as adding the inputfile name that we exported from the the reverse engineering tools
with patched appeneded to the name and the memory locator point and then the output filename as shown in the bewlow output.

```
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ python3 dfuse_pack.py -b 0x08000000:AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0-patched.bin AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target-patched.dfu
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ ls
'Ailunce HS2 FW-V1.3.7 changelog.txt'   AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0.bin           AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target-patched.dfu   dfuse_pack.py
 AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu               AilunceHS2-FW-V1.3.7.dfu.target0.image0-patched.bin   Ailunce-HS2-FW-V1.37.zip
ubuntu@ubuntu2-VirtualBox:~/reverse$ 


```

Then Flash to your radio like normal. Just remeber any changes you make could potentially mess up your radio and i do not take
any responsibility for the actions you perform.




The final result are how the following firmware files are created: https://github.com/Zy0d0x0/HS2-Firmware
